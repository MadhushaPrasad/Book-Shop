## ✅ What's going here?

Libraries are essential to the development of knowledge.
That future begins right now.

Our goal is a future where knowledge is more widely available and more voices are heard.
Where resources and solutions can be "hacked," shared, and networked.
Where information not only offers solutions, but also inspires and empowers.
We believe Diagon Alley can play a role in creating this future.
